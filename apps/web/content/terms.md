## 5. Pro Features & Subscriptions

Certain advanced metrics and alerts are subject to a "Pro" subscription. Pro accounts are tied to a specific wallet address. Subscriptions are non-refundable unless required by law.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

EigenWatch, its founders, and contributors shall not be liable for any financial losses, slashed assets, or technical failures resulting from your participation in restaking protocols or reliance on our analytics.

## 7. Intellectual Property

All content, branding, and algorithms on the Platform are the property of EigenWatch. You may not scrape, redistribute, or reverse-engineer our risk models without explicit written permission.
